Principles of Human-Computer Interaction

The main objective of this project is to not only convey a better understanding between a human and a computer and the depths of how they can interact with each other, but to also provide knowledge and education to users who may be lacking in a vitally important skill. This crucial ability would be how to cook. Specifically, the science and chemistry behind using different ingredients interchangeably in a dish, what the outcome of using different amounts of ingredients like salt and butter, and what different temperatures at different times does to the end product of the dish. This will be performed with the goal of showing how cooking at home is effectively healthier and nutrition for everyone. Additionally, this will be used to test people’s prior knowledge on the subject in order to gauge just how much they understand why they put certain amounts of ingredients in the dishes. This is all accurately portrayed through a carefully designed program that can run on any computer. The person interacting with the computer program is able to perform a variety of different actions with the goal of learning the effect of certain ingredients on the dish while also learning new recipes in the process. The user has a number of different recipes and ingredients to choose from and the person’s culinary knowledge can be put to the test when given the task to make the most edible dish possible.
